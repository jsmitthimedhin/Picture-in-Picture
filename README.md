# Picture-in-Picture
Picture-in-Picture is a clone of the YouTube feature "Picture-in-picture," which allows you to play a video in a mini-window on your screen while other programs are maximized. 

This web application is different since it uses the "share screen" option on your computer so you have more options: a backward facing camera, a second screen to code along with, a PDF file -- all these could be turned into a mini-window in "Picture-in-picture"
